The project has two modules. Brief description of each module is given below:

1) main.py - Entry point the program. Calls the method in utils class to convert input data to list of integers, to find the distribution type and maxima/minima from the list

2) utils.py - Contains the utils class which encompasses all the basic functions from converting input raw data to list of integers, finding the distribution type and finding maxima/minima using the divide and conquer strategy

We are using one input file present in the folder /input
- inputPS4.txt - Contains stream of data in form of integers 

Results/Validation errors/Exceptions will be outputted to 'outputPS4.txt' present in the folder /output
